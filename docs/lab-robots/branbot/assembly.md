# Instructions

## Prepare Acrylic Frames

1. Parts: Lower Acrylic Frame, Upper Acrylic Frame
2. Tools: Screwdriver
3. Steps:
    1. Take a screwdriver and punch through any incompletely drilled holes in
       the Lower and Upper Acrylic Frames.

## Attach the Lidar to the Lower Acrylic Frame ('LAF')

## Attach the Lidar Board to the LAF

## Attach the Charlie Board to the LAF

## Attach the Raspberry Pi to the LAF

## Attach the IMU to the LAF

## Attach the LED Driver to the LAF 

## Attach the Motor Brackets to the LAF

1. Parts: 2 Motor Brackets, 8 M3X11 bolts, 8 M3 nuts
2. Tools: Screwdriver, Plier
3. Steps:
    1. Align a bracket's four holes that form a square with appropriate holes
       in the LAF. 
    2. Fix the bracket to the Frame with bolts and nuts. It helps to hold a nut
       in place with a plier while screwing a bolt into it.
    3. Repeat for the other side.

## Attach the Motor Assemblies to the Brackets

1. Parts: Motor Brackets, 2 Motor Assemblies, 12 M3X6 bolts
2. Tools: Screwdriver
3. Steps:
    1. Ensure that the shaft of a Motor Assembly is positioned such that it
       occupies the lower portion of the large hole in a Motor Bracket. 
    2. Align the holes in the Motor Assembly with those in the Motor Bracket.
    3. Fix the Motor Assembly with the Motor Bracket using 6 M3X6 bolts.
    4. Repeat for the other side.

## Attach the Wheel Adapters to the Motor Assemblies

1. Parts: 2 Wheel Adapters (thick parts, see picture below), 4 Stud bolts (these
   come with the Pololu wheel adapters, and are small headless bolts) 
2. Tools: Screwdriver
3. Steps:
    1. Find the flat edge of the shaft of a Motor Assembly.
    2. Insert a wheel adapter onto the shaft and rotate it such that the two
       holes on the adapter's side align with the mentioned flat edge. Ensure
       that:
       1. the shaft does not stick out through the adapter, but that the end of
          the shaft is flush with the adapter (cf. the picture below). 
       2. The thinner end of the thick wheel adapter faces outward (cf. the
          picture below).
    3. Insert two stud bolts into the two holes to fix the adapter to the shaft.
    4. Repeat for the other side.

## Attach the Fixed Wheels to the Wheel Adapters

1. Parts: 2 Wheel Adapters (thin parts, see picture below), 6 M3X20 bolts
2. Tools Screwdriver
3. Steps:
    1. Insert a Fixed Wheel into the part of the Wheel Adapter that is attached
       to the Motor Assembly.
    2. Insert the thin part of the Wheel Adapter into the central hole of the
       wheel, ensuring that its three holes align with that in the thick part of
       the wheel adpater.
    3. Fix the thin part of the Wheel Adapter to its thick counterpart by
       inserting three M3X20 bolts into the three holes.
    4. Repeat for the other side.
