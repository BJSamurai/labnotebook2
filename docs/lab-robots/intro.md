Over the years we've built up a varied collection of robots. Some are no longer in use and several types still are. This section contains a lot of the robot specific details. Today we use three main robot models:

### Main Robots

1. [Turtlebot3](tb3/home.md)
1. [Platform](platform/home.md)
1. [Branbot](branbot/home.md)

### Software Platform

The Platform and Branbot (as well as some others) are based on the Linorobot platform.
