# Final Project Reports

The following pages are each a project report by a student in Autonomous Robotics at Brandeis University. Here's how to add your content:

a. Git clone this repository to your computer: 
b. In the directory structure, find the folder called reports. In it find the .md file for your project. If you can't find it, then create it.
c. Write your project report using markdown. You can include images as well as links. There are many tutorials on Markdown but you most likely already know it.
d. Git add, commit and push your changes
e. If you did it right then they will appear in the [Labnotebook](https://app.gitbook.com/@campus-rover/s/lab-notebook/final-project-reports/robot_arm)
