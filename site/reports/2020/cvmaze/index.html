<h1 id="computer-vision-maze-solver">Computer Vision Maze Solver</h1>
<h2 id="author-zekai-wang-zhidong-liu">Author: Zekai Wang &amp; Zhidong Liu</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Solving a maze is an interesting sub-task for developing real-world path schedule solutions on robots. Typically, developers prefer to use depth sensors such as lidar or depth camera to walk around in a maze, as there a lots of obstacle walls that the robot need to follow and avoid crashing. Depth sensors have their advantage to directly provide the distance data, which naturally supports the robot to navigate against the obstacles.  </p>
<p>However, we have come up with another idea to solve the maze using the computer vision approach. By reading articles of previous experts working on this area, we know that the RGB image cameras (CMOS or CCD) could also be used to get the depth information when they have multiple frames captured at different points of view at the same time, as long as we have the knowledge of the relative position where the frames are taken. This is basically the intuition of how human eyes work and developers have made a lot of attempts on this approach.  </p>
<p>Though it could calculate the depth data by using cameras no less than 2, it is not as accurate as directly using the depth sensors to measure the environment. Also, the depth calculation and 3D reconstruction requires a lot of computational resource with multiple frames to be processed at the same time. Our hardware resource might not be able to support a real-time response for this computation. So we decide not to use multiple cameras or calculate the depth, but to extract features from a single image that allows the robot to recognize the obstacles.  </p>
<p>The feature extraction from a single frame also requires several image processing steps. The features we chose to track are the lines in the image frames, as when the robot is in a maze boundary lines will could be detected as because walls and the floor could have different colors. We find the lines detected from the frames, which slopes are in certain ranges, are exactly the boundaries between the floor and walls. As a result, we tried serval approaches to extract these lines as the most important feature in the navigation and worked on optimization to let the robot perform more reliable.  </p>
<p>We also implemented several other algorithms to support the robot get out of the maze, including a pid controller. They will be introduced later.</p>
<h3 id="relevant-literature">Relevant literature</h3>
<p>To detect the proper lines stably, we used some traditional algorithms in the world of computer vision to process the frames step by step, including:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gaussian blur to smooth the image, providing more chance to detect the correct lines.<br />

<h3 id="technical-descriptions-illustrations">Technical descriptions, illustrations</h3>
<p>The general idea has already been described in the above sections. In this section we will talk about the detail structure and implementation of the code.  </p>
<p>Some of the algorithms we are using to detect the lines have implementations in the OpenCV library. For the Gaussian, HSV conversion, gray and binary conversion, Canny edge detection and Hough line detection, OpenCV provides packaged functions to easily call and use. At beginning of the project, we just simply tried these functions around in the gazebo simulation environment, with a single script running to try to detect the edge from the scene, which are the boundaries between the floor and the walls.  </p>
<p>When the lines could be stably detected, we tested and adjusted in the real world. After it works properly, we tidy the code and make it a node called the line detector server. It subscribe the image from the robot's camera and always keeping to process the frames into the lines. It publishes the result as a topic where other nodes can subscribe to know about the information of the environment such as whether there is a wall or not. (As in some cases even there is a line at side, there could be no wall, we also check several pixels at the outer side of the line to determine whether there is truly a wall or not)</p>
<p>e.g. left line with left wall (white brick indicates a wall):<br />
<img alt="Figure 1" src="../images/cv_maze/20191216162333.png" /></p>
<p>e.g. left line with no left wall (black brick indicates a floor):<br />
<img alt="Figure 1" src="../images/cv_maze/20191216162518.png" /></p>
<p>Then, we considered about the maze configuration and determined that a maze can have 7 different kinds of possible turns, that are:  </p>
<ol>
<li>crossroad</li>
<li>T-road where the robot comes from the bottom of the 'T'</li>
<li>T-road where the robot comes from the left</li>
<li>T-road where the robot comes from the right</li>
<li>left turn</li>
<li>right turn</li>
<li>dead end</li>
</ol>
<p>We then decided that it is necessary to hard code the solution of these cases and make it an action node to let the robot turn properly as soon as one of such situation is detected. The reason of using the hard-coded solution in a turn is because when the robot walks close to the wall, the light condition will change so sharply that it could not detect the edges correctly. So we let the robot to recognize the type of the turn accurately before it enter and then move forward and/or turn for some pre-defined distances and degrees to pass this turn.  </p>
<p>In order to solve the problem that the pi camera's view of angle is too small, we let robot to stop before enter a turn and turn in place to look left and right for some extra angles so that it will have broad enough view to determine the situation correctly.  </p>
<p>e.g. left line detected correctly<br />
<img alt="Figure 1" src="../images/cv_maze/20191216163119.png" /></p>
<p>e.g. fail to detect the left line, not enough view<br />
<img alt="Figure 1" src="../images/cv_maze/20191216163144.png" /></p>
<p>e.g. turn a bit to fix the problem<br />
<img alt="Figure 1" src="../images/cv_maze/20191216163157.png" /></p>
<p>e.g. no right line, turn and no detection, correct<br />
<img alt="Figure 1" src="../images/cv_maze/20191216163218.png" /></p>
<p>This node is called corner handle action server. When the main node detects that there is a wall (line) in the front which is so near that the robot is about to enter a turn, it will send request to this corner handler to determine the case and drive over the turn.</p>
<p>In order to finally get out the maze, the robot also need a navigation algorithm, which is a part of the corner handler. We chose an easy approach which is the left-wall-follower. The robot will just simply turn left whenever it is possible, or go forward as the secondary choice, or turn right as the third choice, or turn 180 degrees backwards as the last choice. In this logic, the above 7 turn cases can be simplified into these 4 cases. For example, when the robot find there is a way to the left, it does not need to consider the right or front anymore and just simply turn left. When the actions (forward and turning) has been determined, the corner handle action server will send request to another two action servers to actually execute the forward and turning behaviors.</p>
<p>So the general idea is: when the robot detects a turn in the maze by analyzing the lines, its main node will call an action to handle the case and wait until the robot has passed that turn. In other time, the robot will use the pid algorithm to try to keep at the middle of the left and right walls in the maze, going forward until reaches the next turn. We have wrote the pid controller into a service node that the main node will send its request to calculate the robot's angular twist when the robot is not handling turns,  the error is calculated by the different of intercept of left line on x = 0 and right line on x = w (w is the width of the frame image).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have this node relationship diagram<br />

<p>Then the workflow of our whole picture is pretty straightforward. The below flowchart describes it:

<h3 id="discussion-of-interesting-algorithms-modules-techniques">Discussion of interesting algorithms, modules, techniques</h3>
<p>In this section, we briefly talk about some details of the algorithms we use.</p>
<p>The Process of Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down to 5 different steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Apply Gaussian filter to smooth the image in order to remove the noise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the intensity gradients of the image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply non-maximum suppression to get rid of spurious response to edge detection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply double threshold to determine potential edges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track edge by hysteresis: Finalize the detection of edges by suppressing all the other edges that are weak and not connected to strong edges.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The simplest case of Hough transform is detecting straight lines, which is what we use. In general, the straight line y = mx + b can be represented as a point (b, m) in the parameter space. However, vertical lines pose a problem. They would give rise to unbounded values of the slope parameter m. Thus, for computational reasons, Duda and Hart proposed the use of the Hesse normal form</p>
<pre><code>r = x cos ⁡ θ + y sin ⁡ θ
</code></pre>
<p>where r is the distance from the origin to the closest point on the straight line, and θ is the angle between the x axis and the line connecting the origin with that closest point.</p>
<p><img src="../images/cv_maze/R_theta_line.GIF" width="850"></p>
<p>It is therefore possible to associate with each line of the image a pair ( r , θ ).The ( r , θ ) plane is sometimes referred to as Hough space for the set of straight lines in two dimensions. This representation makes the Hough transform conceptually very close to the two-dimensional Radon transform. (They can be seen as different ways of looking at the same transform.)</p>
<p>Given a single point in the plane, then the set of all straight lines going through that point corresponds to a sinusoidal curve in the (r,θ) plane, which is unique to that point. A set of two or more points that form a straight line will produce sinusoids which cross at the (r,θ) for that line. Thus, the problem of detecting collinear points can be converted to the problem of finding concurrent curves.</p>
<p>After use the Hough line algorithm to find a set of straight lines in the frame. we use a slope filter to find a single line which slope is in a particular range and is also closest to a particular reference value. For the front line, we always use the one at most bottom of the frame, which means it is the closest wall.</p>
<p>Pid controller stands for a proportional, integral and derivative controller, which out put is them sum of these three terms, with each of them times a constant factor. </p>
<p>In our pid implementation, the raw input of the error is the term that will times the proportional factor. The integral term is calculated by the sum of the content of a error history deque, which keeps the latest 10 error history values and sum their product with the time gap between each other (graphically the area of a trapezoid). The derivative term is calculated by the difference of the current error and the last error, divided by the difference of their time gap.</p>
<h3 id="story-of-the-project">Story of the project.</h3>
<p>As above mentioned, our project is strongly relied on the accuracy of edge detection. At the beginning, we only apply Gaussian filter to remove the noise in the image then just apply double threshold to determine edges. However, it does not work well. Then we try to convert the denoised  image to a hsv image and convert this hsv image into a binary image before applying canny function. Unfortunately, it does not work every time. Sometimes because of the light and shadow issue it cannot detect the desired edges. Finally, we changed our binary image generation method by considering 3 features, hue, saturation and value, rather than only one feature hue, which turns out works much more robust.</p>
<p>The algorithm to make robot walk straight without hitting the wall is also necessary. At the beginning we applied the traditional wall following algorithm, single side wall following. It only worked on some simple occasions and easily went wrong. What making this single side following algorithm worse is taking turns. Because we use the camera as our only sensor and when taking turns it might lose wall due to the perspective change. Therefore, it is hard to extend the single-side-wall-following algorithm to an all situation handle algorithm. Then we come up with an idea to detect both sides wall. To maintain the robot drives at the middle of road, we got both sides boundaries between ground and wall and maintain those 2 lines intersecting the edges of image at the same height. Another benefit from this algorithm is that the more lines we detected, the more information we get, then the more accurate reflection of surroundings. </p>
